# CarbonFoodPrint Project

The project was developed as part of the Datathon competition, organized by KU Leuven.

The competition consisted of analysing one of two different data sets and developing a prototype application/business solution. The data set selected for the analysis was the EFSA Comprehensive European Food Consumption (available on the the ./food_dataset folder). The app was developed in about 24 hours, by 5 group members.

In order to deploy the app on the browser, just type *python main.py* from the project repository and it will open on your browser.

The app was divided into two parts. Below is shown a map with the different CO2 emissions per country based on dietary preferences by age group.
